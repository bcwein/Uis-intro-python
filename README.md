* Python_data_science_handbook - Notes in form of a jupyter notebook on the book [Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) by Jake Vanderplas. 
* Python_for_data_analysis - Notes in form of a jupyter notebook on the the book [Python for Data Analysis, 2nd Edition](https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book) by Wes McKinney.
* Assignments - Solved assignments from the course.
* Root folder - Anaconda environment, README etc.

**Feel free to use this repository as you see fit.**

## Datasets

The datasets subfolder in the notebooks folder is too large to be commited in this repository.
The datasets must be manually downloaded and added to the Notebooks folder. The datasets can be found
here: https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book

## Anaconda environments

There are currently two environment files in this repository.

1. uis-intro-python.yml
2. uis-intro-python-win10.yml

The first environment is a hand made environemt file. This is to make sure that the environment can be shared across platforms. 

The second environment is automatically created when exporting the environment in anaconda. This environment is a exact description of my environment on my windows 10 system. Compatibility across systems can not be guaranteed.
