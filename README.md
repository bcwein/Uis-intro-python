# Python repository for DAT540

by Bj√∏rn Christian Weinbach - MsC Data Science

This repository contains my code for DAT540 - Introduction to data science.

As of 28.08.2020 the repository contains the following folders:

* Notebooks - Jupyter notebooks
* Root folder - Anaconda environment, README etc

**Feel free to use this repository as you see fit.**

## Anaconda environments

There are currently two environment files in this repository.

1. uis-intro-python.yml
2. uis-intro-python-win10.yml

The first environment is a hand made environemt file. This is to make sure that the environment can be shared across platforms. 

The second environment is automatically created when exporting the environment in anaconda. This environment is a exact description of my environment on my windows 10 system. Compatibility across systems can not be guaranteed.
