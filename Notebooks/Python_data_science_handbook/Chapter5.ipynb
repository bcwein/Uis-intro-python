    "# Chapter 5. Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In many ways, machine learning is the primary means by which data science manifests itself to the broader world. Machine learning is where these computational and algorithmic skills of data science meet the statistical thinking of data science, and the result is a collection of approaches to inference and data exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will dive into practical aspects of machine learning, primarily using python's scikit-learn package.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is machine-learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning has risen form the field of artificial intelligence but is more focused on building mathematical models to help understand data. \"Learning\" enters the fray when we give these models *tunable parameters* that can be adapted to observed data. \n",
    "\n",
    "When these models have been fit to previously seen data, they can be used to predictand understand aspects of newly observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Categories of machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "At the most fundemental level, machine learning can be categorized into two main types: \n",
    "- **supervised learning** involves somehow modeling the relationship between measured features of data and some label associated with the data. Once this model is determined, it can be used to apply labels to new, unknown data. This is further subdivided into **classification** tasks and **regression** tass. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **unsupervised learning** involves modeling the features of a datasat without reference to any label, and is often described as \"letting the data speak for itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introducing Scikit-learn\n",
    "There are several Python libraries that provide solid implementations of a range of machine learning algorithms. One of the best known is Scikit-Learn, a package that provides efficient versions of a large number of commong algorithms. Scikit-Learn is carachterized by a clean, uniform, and streamlined API, as well as by very useful and complete online documentation. A benefint of this uniforminty is that once you understand the basic use and syntax of Scikit-earn for one type of model, switching to a new model or algorithms is very straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Representation in Scikit-Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is about creating models from data: for that reason, we'll start by discussing how data can be represented in order to be understood by the computer. The best way to think about data withing scikit-learn is in terms of tables of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data as table\n",
    "\n",
    "A abasic table is a two-dimensional grid of data, in which the rows represent individual elements of the dataset, and the columns represent quantities related to each of these elements. For example, consider the *iris dataset*, famously analyzed by Ronald Fisher in 1936. We can download this dataset in the form of a Pandas DataFrame using the seaborn library"

    "Here each row of data refers to a single observed flower, and the number of rows is the total number of flowers in the dataset. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The table layout makes clear that the information can be thought of as a two-dimensional numerical array or matrix, which we will cal the **features matrix**. By convention, this features matrix is often stored in a variable named $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Target array\n",
    "In addition to the features matrix $X$, we also generally work with a *label* or *target* array, which by convention we will usually call $y$ The target is usually one dimensional, with length $\\text{n_samples}$ and is generally contained in a numpy array or pandas series.\n",

    "We first see that there is a relatively stable trend in the weekly baseline: there are many more riders on weekdays than on weekends and holidays. We see that for each additional hour of daylight, 129 ± 9 more people choose to ride; a temperature increase of one degree Celsius encourages 65 ± 4 people to grab their bicycle; a dry day means an average of 548 ± 33 more riders, and each inch of precipitation means 665 ± 62 more people leave their bike at home. Once all these effects are accounted for, we see a modest increase of 27 ± 18 new daily riders each year.\n",

    "Our model is almost certainly missing some relevant information. For example, nonlinear effects (such as effects of precipitation and cold temperature) and nonlinear trends within each variable (such as disinclination to ride at very cold and very hot temperatures) cannot be accounted for in this model. Additionally, we have thrown away some of the finer-grained information (such as the difference between a rainy morning and a rainy afternoon), and we have ignored correlations between days (such as the possible effect of a rainy Tuesday on Wednesday's numbers, or the effect of an unexpected sunny day after a streak of rainy days). These are all potentially interesting effects, and you now have the tools to begin exploring them if you wish!"
